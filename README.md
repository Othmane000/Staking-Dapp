# Staking-Dapp
Staking dapp for generative python NFTs


This project is for experimenting the creation of a NFT collection from scratch and learning about blokchain 
development. In this project I wrote a python script which creates random images. We upload the images to ipfs using pinata and then the metadata is generated for each image using a another python script
After that we start writing the smart-contracts for minting one of these NFTs, staking them and getting ERC20 token rewards from them. Then we create a simple frontend so that users can mint and stake NFTs, the users can then stake/unstake their NFTs and also claim rewards without unstaking their NFT.
To be able to mint you first need to be approved by the smart-contract creator address (mine).


This project is not meant to make any money but only to show my work as a beginner dev !


Check out the collection on opensea-testnet : https://testnets.opensea.io/collection/othmane-hachads-pyart-collection

How to check out the collection's frontend :
 - clone the repository on your computer
 - change your working directory to "dapp"
 - run the following command "npm start"
 - Have fun minting ! ( dont forget to get faucet eth ;) )
